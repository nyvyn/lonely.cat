# Lonely Cat

A tiny browser playground for a lonely cat that wants to be cared for. The game is built with [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) and uses Matter.js physics and a small [Behavior3JS](https://github.com/behavior3/behavior3js) tree to drive the cat's actions.

Click anywhere in the canvas and the cat will wander over. When left alone it roams the world on its own.

## Development

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000> in your browser to play with the cat.

## Tests

Run the unit tests with:

```bash
npm test
```
